# Dynamic Pricing: Unlocking Value with Real-Time Intelligence

This project demonstrates how businesses can apply dynamic pricing strategies using machine learning to make smarter, real-time pricing decisions.

Inspired by ride-hailing use cases, the project showcases how prices can be optimized based on operational data - such as demand, time, and service tier - to increase revenue, improve margin, and enhance customer experience.

## Why Dynamic Pricing Matters

Fixed prices may seem predictable - but they rarely reflect real-world complexity. Businesses often:

* Leave money on the table during peak demand
* Slash prices randomly during low sales periods

**Dynamic pricing** enables smarter decisions by continuously aligning prices with customer behavior, demand, inventory, and the competitive landscape.

## Project Highlights

This project demonstrates:

* How to use operational and contextual variables to optimize pricing
* How a machine learning model can generate fair, responsive fare estimates
* How to deploy pricing predictions through a live API

## How Dynamic Pricing Works

A dynamic pricing engine operates in five key stages:

1. **Ingest Data**  
   Monitor relevant variables such as demand levels, time of day, location, vehicle type, and more.

2. **Train Model**  
   Use historical data to learn how different pricing scenarios influence customer behavior and demand patterns.

3. **Optimize Prices**  
   Calculate price points that align with business objectives such as revenue growth, customer retention, and inventory management.

4. **Implement Real-time**  
   Instantly apply optimized prices across digital channels like mobile apps and web platforms.

5. **Learn Continuously**  
   Feed real-time performance data back into the system to refine and improve pricing accuracy over time.

## Sample Use Case: Ride Fare Prediction

This ride-fare pricing system predicts optimal prices using inputs such as:

* Ride demand
* Trip distance
* Hour of the day
* Day of the week
* Vehicle type

It processes this data and recommends a price that balances revenue potential with fairness.

### Sample Input

```json
{
  "trips_this_hour": 150,
  "trip_distance_km": 10.5,
  "hour": 19,
  "day": "Friday",
  "vehicle_type": "rideXL"
}
```

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "predicted_fare": 28.75
}
```

## Business Value

Dynamic pricing can help:

* Increase revenue by 2-5% annually
* Improve profit margins by aligning prices with true demand
* Turn pricing teams from manual operators into strategic analysts
* Respond to competitor price changes in real time
* Maintain pricing fairness across customer segments

## Supporting Thought Leadership

As part of this project, I authored:

ðŸ”— **LinkedIn Article â€“ Unlock Revenue with Dynamic Pricing**
A business-focused guide that:

* Introduces dynamic pricing concepts in plain language
* Explains how pricing systems work (from data ingestion to real-time updates)
* Offers examples of strategic use cases
* Provides an implementation roadmap for executives

---

## Getting Started (For Demo Purposes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/Mobolaji-Salawu/Dynamic-Pricing-with-Machine-Learning.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the API (optional)
uvicorn dynamic_pricing_app:app --reload
```

## Future Business Applications

The system's design can be adapted for:

* Retail price optimization
* Airline or hotel yield management
* Subscription tier pricing
* Promotions based on supply-demand elasticity
