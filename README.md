# Dynamic Pricing: Unlocking Revenue with Real-Time Intelligence

This project demonstrates how businesses can apply dynamic pricing strategies using machine learning to make smarter, real-time pricing decisions. Inspired by ride-hailing use cases, the project showcases how prices can be optimized based on operational data — such as demand, time, and service tier — to increase revenue, improve margin, and enhance customer experience.

## Why Dynamic Pricing Matters

Fixed prices may seem predictable — but they rarely reflect real-world complexity. Businesses often:

* Leave money on the table during peak demand
* Slash prices randomly during low sales periods

**Dynamic pricing** enables smarter decisions by continuously aligning prices with customer behavior, demand, inventory, and the competitive landscape.

## Project Highlights

This project demonstrates:

* 📊 How to use operational and contextual variables to optimize pricing
* 🤖 How a machine learning model can generate fair, responsive fare estimates
* 🖥️ How to deploy pricing predictions through a live API using FastAPI
* ✍️ How to communicate the strategic value of dynamic pricing to business audiences

## 📈 What the System Does

This ride-fare pricing system predicts optimal prices using inputs such as:

* Number of trips currently booked
* Trip distance
* Hour of the day and day of the week
* Vehicle type (Standard, Premium, etc.)

It processes this data, infers pricing sensitivity based on context (e.g., "Evening Rush" vs. "Night Low Demand"), and recommends a price that balances revenue potential with fairness.

### Sample Input

```json
{
  "trips_this_hour": 150,
  "trip_distance_km": 10.5,
  "hour": 19,
  "day": "Friday",
  "vehicle_type": "Premium"
}
```

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "predicted_fare": 28.75,
  "booking_time": "Evening"
}
```

## 🧠 Business Value

Dynamic pricing can help:

* Increase revenue by 2–5% annually
* Improve profit margins by aligning prices with true demand
* Turn pricing teams from manual operators into strategic analysts
* Respond to competitor price changes in real time
* Maintain pricing fairness across customer segments
